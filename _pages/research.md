# Research

Our overarching goal is broaden the horizon of understanding of audio signal from a scientific and engineering perspective. We think this 21st century signal holds promise to enhance our interaction with the world we live in. In this quest, we utilize crictical thinking, systematic experimentation, and indepth analysis to enable us address questions we find most interesting.

This is possible thanks also to Neeraj's broad background with different research themes: speech signal modeling and audio signal processing (at IISc), understanding speech perception using behavioral and neural signals (at CMU), sound-based respiratory health diagnosis (at IISc), and spatial audio cognition (at Fraunhofer IIS).

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Human-machine perception and cognition**\

**Audio signal processing for human healthcare**\

**Audio signal processing for climate sciences**\

**Speech signal analysis, manipulation, and synthesis**\

**Signal processing, sampling and reconstructio**\

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB. -->

For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI. -->
